# Dungeon-Game


A small two level mobile stealth game I made using Unity and C#. Choose your weapon and make your way through the levels fighting skeletons and collecting coins.

Planned future features include for example a system for buying weapons with collected coins.

Downloadable .apk file for android phones.
